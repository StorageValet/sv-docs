## 💡 Tips for Your AI Team

1. **Always ask in natural language** - Claude fetches docs automatically
2. **Be specific** - "How do I setup RLS policies?" vs "Tell me about RLS"
3. **Reference docs appear in answers** - Save these links for team training
4. **Fallback to local docs** - If MCP is slow, check `platform-docs/`
5. **Mix platforms** - "How do I connect my Vercel app to Supabase?"

---

## 🔄 What Gets Updated Automatically

- **Supabase**: ✅ Real-time (via MCP)
- **Vercel**: ✅ Real-time (via MCP)
- **React**: ✅ Weekly (GitHub Actions)
- **Stripe**: ⚠️ Manual (docs available via questions)
- **Tahoe**: 📋 On-demand (via MCP when queried)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "MCP Failed to Connect"
- Supabase: Already working ✅
- Vercel: Ask a Vercel question to trigger OAuth
- Stripe: Use question-based approach or CLI
- Tahoe: Activate when needed

### "API Key or Auth Issues"
- **Supabase**: Already configured ✅
- **Vercel**: OAuth happens on first query
- **Stripe**: Key is configured, CLI has minor quirk
- Check `claude mcp list` to see status

### "Documentation is Outdated"
- MCP servers always fetch latest
- Local copies update on schedule
- Check links in platform-docs README

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Try asking a Vercel question to activate OAuth
- [ ] Reference the QUICK_MCP_REFERENCE.md for common questions
- [ ] Share setup guide with your AI team

### Short Term (This Week)
- [ ] Monitor MCP performance
- [ ] Update Stripe approach if needed
- [ ] Begin using docs for daily development

### Long Term (This Month)
