# Development Checkpoint — October 31, 2025
**Prepared for:** Evening wrap-up  
**Lead:** Zach Brown  
**Repositories:** `sv-db`, `sv-edge`, `sv-portal`, `sv-docs`  
**Deployment Target:** Production (Supabase + Vercel)

---

## 1. Accomplishments (Tonight)

- **Database Security Restored**
  - Applied migrations `0005_billing_status_tracking` and `0006_enable_rls_and_security`.
  - Registered/apply `0007_fix_subscription_enum_and_rls` (ENUM extension + inventory_events INSERT policy).
  - Verified RLS enabled on `customer_profile`, `items`, `actions`, `claims`, `inventory_events` (total 33 policies).
  - Automated smoke test (`sv-db/runbooks/rls_smoke_test.mjs`) confirms cross-tenant isolation and timeline logging.
- **Portal Security/UI Patch**
  - Merged `fix/portal-security` → `main`.
  - `Account.tsx` now displays all 9 Stripe subscription statuses with contextual messaging.
  - TypeScript build clean; Vercel deployment succeeded.
- **Incident Management**
  - Security incident documented and closed (`sv-docs/runbooks/SECURITY_INCIDENT_2025-10-31_RLS_DISABLED.md`).
  - Deployment plan recorded (`sv-docs/runbooks/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_ACCOUNT_PATCH_2025-10-31.md`).
- **QA Observations Logged**
  - Created `sv-docs/runbooks/QA_OBSERVATIONS_2025-10-31.md` capturing navigation gap, photo display bug, and volume calculation issue.

## 2. Outstanding Tasks Before Launch

| Area | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Security** | Rotate Supabase `service_role` key | Zach | ⏳ Pending | Required because key was exported during testing. Update all env files and Supabase Edge deploy secrets. |
| | Monitor RLS logs for anomalies post-deploy | Ops | ⏳ Pending | Check Supabase logs next business day. |
| **Portal QA** | Fix Account page navigation layout | Frontend | ⏳ Pending | Extract shared header/AppLayout so `/account` has nav links. |
| | Investigate photo upload not rendering | Frontend + Storage | ⏳ Pending | Likely `photo_paths` vs. `photo_path` regression; verify Supabase storage and dashboard fetch. |
| | Correct item volume calculation | Frontend | ⏳ Pending | Recalculate cubic feet (`L*W*H/1728`) or ensure the computed field uses newest column names. |
| | Execute high-priority manual smoke test after fixes | Zach / QA | ⏳ Pending | Cover add/edit/delete item, schedule pickup, account updates, badge states; attach screenshots. |
| **Billing Automation** | Verify Supabase tier supports `pg_cron` | Zach | ⏳ Pending | Blocking decision for delayed activation flow. |
| | Outline Migration 0008 requirements (setup fee + cron job) | Backend | ⏳ Pending | Draft schema changes + deployment order. |
| **Documentation** | Update 90-case validation checklist with new issues | Docs lead | ⏳ Pending | Incorporate findings from QA log and smoke test script. |
| | Prepare customer-facing release notes | Product | ⏳ Pending | Summarize security hardening + upcoming billing changes. |

## 3. Process Reminders

- **Change Control**
  - No edits to previously applied migrations; always append (`0008`, `0009`, etc.).
  - Record all production migrations via Supabase CLI so they appear in `schema_migrations`.
- **Testing**
  - Automated RLS smoke test must run before every deployment touching auth/policies.
  - Manual QA to follow the template in `QA_OBSERVATIONS_2025-10-31.md`.
- **Secrets Handling**
  - Avoid storing service-role keys in shell history (`unset` after use).
  - Maintain rotation log with timestamps & owners.

2. [ ] Navigation layout fix merged and deployed.
3. [ ] Photo display bug resolved, tested with real uploads.
4. [ ] Volume calculation bug resolved; cards show accurate cu ft.
5. [ ] QA smoke tests rerun (automated + manual), results appended to QA observations.
6. [ ] Billing automation plan approved (pg_cron decision, migration draft).
7. [ ] Release notes drafted, stakeholders notified.

Once all boxes are checked, we can proceed with final Phase 1 sign-off and move toward billing automation implementation.
