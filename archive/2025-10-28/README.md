# Storage Valet Documentation Archive - Oct 28, 2025

**Archived:** October 28, 2025
**Reason:** Documentation cleanup to reduce bloat and prevent agents from referencing outdated information

## What's Archived Here

This folder contains historical documentation that was accurate at the time but has since been superseded by current implementation or made obsolete by architectural changes.

**Common reasons for archival:**
- Duplicate/superseded content (e.g., multiple versions of same doc)
- Session summaries that are now historical
- Decision documents that have been resolved
- Phase 0.x documentation (project is now in Phase 1)
- Outdated deployment statuses
- Old validation checklists replaced by newer versions

## Active Documentation Location

**Current docs:** `~/code/sv-docs/`

**Key active documents:**
- CLAUDE.md files (in each repo)
- PHASE_1_* documents
- Current runbooks (PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md, PHASE_1_MANUAL_TEST_SCRIPT.md)
- Platform-specific docs (platform-docs/)

## Restoration

If you need to reference or restore any archived document:
1. Files are organized by original location
2. All original timestamps preserved
3. Simply copy back to `~/code/sv-docs/` if needed

**Note:** This archive is for historical context only. AI agents should NOT reference these documents during active development.
