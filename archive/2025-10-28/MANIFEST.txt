- 12 runbooks  
- 8 platform-docs

ARCHIVE LOCATION: ~/code/sv-docs-archive-oct28-2025/
RESTORE: Simply copy files back to ~/code/sv-docs/ if needed

CLEANUP RESULTS:
- 40% reduction in active documentation
- Removed outdated pricing references
- Removed Phase 0 historical docs
- Removed resolved decision docs
- Kept all Phase 1 current docs
- Kept foundational architecture plan

NEXT STEPS FOR AGENTS:
- Read ACTIVE_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for current doc list
- DO NOT reference archived docs during development
- Use archived docs only for historical context if explicitly needed
- Always check Implementation Plan for architectural constraints
