## Critical Path to Launch

### Immediate Actions Required (Week 1)

1. **Verify Current Deployments** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - [ ] Check Vercel deployment status (which commit is live?)
   - [ ] Verify Vercel environment variables are set
   - [ ] Check Supabase Edge Functions deployment status
   - [ ] Verify Supabase Edge secrets are set
   - [ ] Confirm Stripe mode (test vs. live)

   - [ ] Run through all 90+ test cases in PHASE_1_MANUAL_TEST_SCRIPT.md
   - [ ] Document bugs in BUG_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md
   - [ ] Triage bugs (critical vs. nice-to-have)

5. **Fix Critical Bugs** (Priority: HIGH)
   - [ ] Address any bugs that block launch
   - [ ] Re-test fixed bugs
   - [ ] Update validation checklist

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH RISK
1. **Migration 0004 not applied** - Phase 1 features will break without this schema
   - Mitigation: Apply immediately with validation script

2. **Unclear deployment status** - Don't know what's actually live
   - Mitigation: Audit all environments ASAP

3. **No E2E testing completed** - Phase 1 features untested
   - Mitigation: Execute manual test script this week

### üü° MEDIUM RISK
4. **Stripe mode unclear** - May be in test mode when should be live (or vice versa)
   - Mitigation: Verify and document current mode

5. **Vercel cache issue** - Oct 17 notes indicate old code served
   - Mitigation: Deploy with explicit cache clear

6. **Environment variable drift** - Unclear if staging/prod have correct values
   - Mitigation: Audit and document all environment variables

### üü¢ LOW RISK
7. **Performance at scale** - Untested with 100+ items per user
   - Mitigation: Start with limited beta users

8. **Email deliverability** - Tested Oct 13 but may have changed
   - Mitigation: Re-test with production domain
