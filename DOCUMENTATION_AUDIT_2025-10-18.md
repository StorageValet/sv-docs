# Documentation Audit Summary — Phase-1 Strategic Shift

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Auditor**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Purpose**: Update all documentation to reflect Phase-1 strategic shift and remove outdated constraints
**Trigger**: 24-hour period of heavy strategic changes (Oct 17-18, 2025)

---

## Executive Summary

This audit updated 6 core documentation files to:
1. **Capture the strategic shift** from minimalist constraints to feature-complete customer portal
2. **Remove outdated hard limits** on LOC/files/dependencies that were preventing essential features
3. **Preserve architectural constraints** that remain non-negotiable (4 routes, RLS, Stripe Hosted, etc.)
4. **Document Sprint 0 completion** and Migration 0004 validation results
5. **Provide clarity** for future developers joining the project

**Result**: All documentation now accurately reflects the project's current state and Phase-1 direction.

### 6. `FINAL_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST_v3.1.md` (original, not Phase1 version)
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT UPDATED (intentional)
**Reason**: This is the Phase 0.6/0.6.1 checklist. Phase-1 items go in `FINAL_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST_v3.1_PHASE1.md` instead.

---

## Files NOT Changed (And Why)

### Runbooks (Intentionally Preserved):
- `runbooks/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_v3.1.md` - Deployment instructions unchanged
- `runbooks/PHASE_0.6_GATES_v3.1.md` - Historical Phase 0.6 gates preserved
- `runbooks/BUILD_SUMMARY_v3.1.md` - Historical build summary preserved
- `runbooks/WEBHOOK_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures unchanged
- `runbooks/VERCEL_SETUP_COMPLETE_2025-10-13.md` - Historical record preserved

**Rationale**: These are historical records or procedural docs that don't reference outdated constraints.

### Migration Files (Never Changed):
- `sv-db/migrations/*.sql` - Migrations are immutable after application

### Edge Functions (No Changes Needed):
- `sv-edge/functions/*` - Phase-1 doesn't require Edge Function changes yet

---

WHY CHANGED:
Phase-1 strategic shift (Oct 17-18, 2025) removed artificial LOC/file/dep
constraints that prevented essential customer features. Documentation needed
to reflect that architectural constraints (4 routes, RLS, Stripe Hosted, etc.)
remain non-negotiable while code metrics are now quality guidelines.

This ensures any developer/agent stepping into the project can understand:
1. Why constraints changed (business necessity over metrics)
2. What stayed the same (architectural discipline)
3. Current project state (Sprint 0 complete, ready for Sprint 1)

FILES CHANGED: 6 updated, 4 created
LINES CHANGED: ~500 additions/modifications
VALIDATION: All docs consistent, no contradictions
```

---

## Conclusion

This audit successfully updated all critical documentation to reflect the Phase-1 strategic shift. The project now has clear, consistent, and complete documentation that:

1. **Explains the pivot** from minimalist constraints to feature-complete portal
2. **Preserves architectural integrity** while relaxing code metrics
3. **Documents Sprint 0 completion** with validation proof
4. **Provides onboarding clarity** for future developers

**Next Step**: Commit all documentation changes to sv-docs repository.
