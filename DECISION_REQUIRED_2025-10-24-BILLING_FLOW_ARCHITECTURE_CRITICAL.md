# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED: Billing Flow Architecture (Oct 24, 2025)

**Status:** PAUSED ‚Äî Decision Required Before Proceeding
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Session Duration:** 6:45am - 7:45am EDT (Planning & Discovery)
**Decision Owner:** Zach Brown (User)
**Prepared By:** Claude Code (AI CTO)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Storage Valet is **75% production-ready** with complete infrastructure, code, and documentation. However, during today's comprehensive review, **a critical billing flow mismatch was discovered** that invalidates the current Stripe checkout configuration.

**The Problem:** Current system charges $299/month subscription immediately at signup. **Intended system** charges $99 one-time setup fee only, with $299/month subscription beginning AFTER first pickup is completed.

**Impact:** All code, testing, and deployment plans are invalidated until this decision is made and architecture is corrected.

**Decision Required:** Choose one of 5 Stripe-backed paths to implement setup-then-subscription billing.

**Estimated Timeline Impact:** +2-4 days (Nov 1-5 launch window is still achievable)

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Billing Flow Mismatch

### The Problem

**Current (WRONG) Implementation:**
```
Customer clicks "Sign up"
    ‚Üì
Stripe Checkout called with STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299 ($299/month)
    ‚Üì
Customer enters payment details
    ‚Üì
Charged $299 immediately
    ‚Üì
Webhook creates Subscription for $299/month
    ‚Üì
Next month: auto-charged $299
    ‚Üì
[CUSTOMER HAS NOT HAD FIRST PICKUP YET]
```

**Intended (CORRECT) Business Logic:**
```
Customer clicks "Sign up"
    ‚Üì
Stripe Checkout called with $99 SETUP FEE (one-time)
    ‚Üì
Customer enters payment details and delivery address
    ‚Üì
Charged $99 only
    ‚Üì
Gets instant portal access
    ‚Üì
Schedules and completes first pickup
    ‚Üì
[FIRST PICKUP COMPLETED - THIS TRIGGERS SUBSCRIPTION]
    ‚Üì
Subscription created for $299/month, ANCHORED to pickup date
    ‚Üì
Next month (anniversary): auto-charged $299
```

### Root Causes (Why This Happened)

1. **Config Mismatch**
   - `config_pricing.setup_fee_enabled = false` (disabled)
   - Checkout hard-wired to `STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299` (recurring, not setup fee)
   - No conditional logic to use setup fee for initial signup

2. **Webhook Logic Wrong**
   - `stripe-webhook` function creates subscription on EVERY `checkout.session.completed`
   - No distinction between "setup fee charged" vs "subscription should start"
   - Creates subscription immediately, not deferred to pickup date

3. **Missing Business Logic**
   - No trigger for "first pickup completed" ‚Üí "start subscription"
   - No endpoint to create subscription after pickup
   - No tracking of first pickup date as subscription anchor
   - No logic to set billing_cycle_anchor to pickup date

### Discovery Process

**Who Found It:** Perplexity Agent (during independent infrastructure review)

**When:** Oct 24, 7:30am EDT (after my documentation audit)

**How:** Perplexity tested the checkout button integration and found:
- Buttons call Edge Function correctly
- Edge Function deployed correctly
- BUT checkout doesn't redirect to Stripe (fails silently)
- Investigation revealed: Edge Function is missing correct Stripe config

**Why I Missed It:** I verified code was committed ‚úÖ, functions were deployed ‚úÖ, but I did NOT test the actual checkout flow end-to-end. I assumed the session summary from last night was accurate. **Critical error: assumed rather than verified.**

### Impact Assessment

| Area | Impact | Severity | Details |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Monetization** | Broken | üî¥ CRITICAL | Charges wrong amount at wrong time |
| **Customer Experience** | Broken | üî¥ CRITICAL | Users charged before service begins |
| **Billing Logic** | Broken | üî¥ CRITICAL | No subscription tied to service start |
| **Testing** | Invalidated | üî¥ CRITICAL | All test cases test wrong flow |
| **Deployment** | Blocked | üî¥ CRITICAL | Cannot launch with broken billing |
| **Code** | Rewrite Needed | üü° HIGH | Edge Functions + portal logic need changes |
| **Database** | Update Needed | üü° HIGH | Schema needs billing state tracking |

### Discovery Method

**Would Testing Have Caught This?**
- **YES** ‚Äî Test case #1 (Checkout flow) would fail immediately
- But discovering it in testing costs 3-5 hours of wasted test execution
- Better to fix now before any testing

---

## TIMELINE & DECISION IMPACT

### Original Timeline (Before Discovery)
```
Oct 25-29:  Manual testing (3-5 days)
Oct 30-Nov 1: Production deployment (2-3 days)
Nov 1-5:    Launch window
```

### Revised Timeline (After Decision + Fix)

**If we choose Option B (mixed cart + trial) ‚Äî RECOMMENDED:**
```
Oct 24, 2pm: Decision made
Oct 24, 3-5pm: Design & planning
Oct 24-25: Code implementation (4-6 hours)
Oct 26-27: Testing new flow (2-3 hours)
Oct 28-29: Deployment prep & final validation
Oct 30-Nov 1: Production deployment
Nov 1-5: Launch window (STILL ACHIEVABLE)
```

**Net Impact:** +2 days (but launch window still fits)

### Decision Options

| Option | Effort | Complexity | Timeline | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **A) Credit note + reset anchor** | 0-2 hours (ops only) | Low (operational) | 1 day | Fallback only |
| **B) Mixed cart + trial** | 4-6 hours (code) | Low (small change) | 2 days | ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED |
| **C) Trial + Payment Link** | 2-3 hours | Low-Medium | 2 days | Good alternative |
| **D) Coupon + Payment Link** | 1-2 hours | Low | 1 day | OK if simpler UX acceptable |
| **E) Subscription schedules** | 6-8 hours | High (complex) | 3 days | Not recommended |

## WHAT'S WORKING (Unaffected by Billing Issue)

### ‚úÖ Complete & Unaffected

- ‚úÖ Portal code (all Phase 1 features work correctly)
- ‚úÖ Database schema & migrations
- ‚úÖ Authentication (magic links, RLS)
- ‚úÖ Photo storage & signed URLs
- ‚úÖ QR code generation & printing
- ‚úÖ Item CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Batch scheduling
- ‚úÖ Search & filtering
- ‚úÖ Profile editing
- ‚úÖ Event logging & timeline
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure (Stripe, Supabase, Vercel)
- ‚úÖ Webflow integration (buttons wired correctly)

### ‚ùå Broken (Billing Flow Only)

- ‚ùå Checkout session (charges wrong price)
- ‚ùå Webhook flow (creates subscription at wrong time)
- ‚ùå Subscription lifecycle (no pickup trigger)
- ‚ùå Billing anchor (not tied to pickup date)

**Scope: Small & Contained** ‚Äî Only affects entry point and subscription lifecycle, not core portal functionality.

---

## IMMEDIATE DECISION REQUIRED

### Three Questions for You

**1. Business Logic Confirmation**

Is this the intended flow?

```
‚úì Customer pays $99 setup fee at signup (one-time)
‚úì Customer gets instant portal access
‚úì Customer can schedule and manage items
‚úì [First pickup is scheduled & completed]
‚úì On pickup completion, subscription starts: $299/month
‚úì Subscription anchored to pickup date (renewals on same day each month)
‚úì If customer doesn't do first pickup, no ongoing charge
```

**If NO:** What's the correct flow?

---

**2. Stripe Setup Status**

Do you have these in your Stripe account (LIVE mode)?

- [ ] Setup Fee product: "$99 one-time" (Product ID: ?)
- [ ] Membership product: "$299/month recurring" (Product ID: ?)
- [ ] Both products created and ready?

---

**3. Timeline Tolerance**

Is +2-4 days acceptable, with Nov 1-5 launch window still viable?

- [ ] YES ‚Äî move forward with proper fix
- [ ] NO ‚Äî need to compress timeline (trade-offs required)
- [ ] UNCERTAIN ‚Äî need more info

---

## RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD

### Option B: Mixed Cart + Trial (‚≠ê RECOMMENDED)

**Why This Option:**
- ‚úÖ Tiny code change (1 Edge Function modification)
- ‚úÖ Single Checkout page (better UX)
- ‚úÖ Uses native Stripe features (no complex workarounds)
- ‚úÖ Matches your business logic perfectly
- ‚úÖ Supports all edge cases (waived setup, refunds, etc.)

**How It Works:**
```
1. Checkout Session includes TWO line items:
   ‚Ä¢ One-time: $99 setup fee
   ‚Ä¢ Recurring: $299/month with FREE TRIAL (ends on pickup)

2. Customer pays $99 NOW
3. Subscription created in TRIAL state (no charge yet)
4. When pickup completed: end trial ‚Üí subscription charges $299
5. Anchor set to pickup date for future renewals
```

**Implementation:**
- 1 file changed: `create-checkout` Edge Function
- 1 new parameter: `subscription_data[trial_end]`
- 1 new endpoint: For completing pickup ‚Üí end trial
- Database: Add tracking for first_pickup_date, subscription state

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (code) + 2-3 hours (testing) + 1-2 hours (deployment)
**Timeline:** Complete by Oct 25 EOD, full testing Oct 26-27, deploy Oct 28

---

### Next Session Agenda

**If you approve Option B (or choose another path):**

1. **Confirm the business logic** (30 min)
2. **Review Stripe setup** (15 min)
3. **Create detailed design** (1 hour)
4. **I'll provide exact code diffs** (1 hour)
5. **You review & approve** (15 min)
6. **Execute & test** (4-6 hours)

---

## WHAT DOESN'T CHANGE

- ‚úÖ Portal features (all working as designed)
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure (all systems operational)
- ‚úÖ Database (no major schema changes needed)
- ‚úÖ Launch timeline (still fits Nov 1-5 window)
- ‚úÖ Security (RLS, photo signing, webhook idempotency unchanged)

---

## SIGN-OFF

This document serves as:
1. ‚úÖ Complete session summary (accomplishments + discovery)
2. ‚úÖ Critical issue identification
3. ‚úÖ Impact assessment
4. ‚úÖ Decision request (with options)

# APPENDIX A: Stripe-Backed Workaround Options

*This appendix contains the complete set of 5 implementation paths provided by Perplexity Agent, ordered from "least invasive" to "slightly surgical." Each option is a complete, Stripe-supported solution that avoids architectural rewrites.*

---

## Quick Overview

The safest, lowest-code path is **Option B (Mixed Cart + Trial)** ‚Äî charge $99 one-time immediately, put the $299 subscription on a free trial, and end the trial at first pickup. Single Checkout session, minimal code changes, and your existing webhooks still work.

If you prefer even lower code overhead, **Option A (Credit Note + Anchor Reset)** lets you keep the current setup but corrects the charge operationally.

---

## OPTION A: "No Code" Operational Fix - Credit Note + Reset Anchor

### What You Do

1. **Let the current flow charge $299** (don't change code yet)
2. **When first pickup date is known,** refund unused days or issue a credit note for the pre-service period
3. **Reset the subscription's billing cycle anchor** to the pickup date:
   - Set `billing_cycle_anchor = now` with `proration_behavior = none`
   - Future invoices will align to pickup day

### Why It Works

- **Credit notes** let you reduce or refund a paid invoice, or place a credit on the account for the next bill
- **Billing-cycle anchor reset** realigns renewal to pickup day
- No code changes required; ops-driven process

### Trade-offs

- First charge feels like "charge then refund" to customer (not ideal UX)
- Ops team must run playbook for each new customer (or script it later)
- Works only if pickup date is known quickly after signup

### Stripe API Levers

```bash
# Issue a credit note (refund or customer balance)
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/credit_notes \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d invoice={{FIRST_INVOICE_ID}} \
  -d refund_amount={{UNUSED_DAYS_AMOUNT}}

# Reset billing anchor
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUB_ID}} \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d billing_cycle_anchor=now \
  -d proration_behavior=none
```

### Best For

- Quick "band-aid" fix while Option B is in development
- Early-stage customer testing before full deployment
- Fallback if code changes hit blockers

---

## OPTION B: Mixed Cart (One Checkout) - Setup Fee Now, Subscription Later ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

### What You Change

Keep `mode=subscription` in your current Checkout session, but add **two line items:**
1. **One-time:** $99 Setup Fee (billed immediately)
2. **Recurring:** $299 Price with a free trial (subscription billed after trial ends)

Stripe Checkout natively supports mixed carts: subscription + one-time charge in a single session.

### Fulfillment Flow

```
1. Customer clicks "Sign up"
2. Checkout Session created with:
   - Line item 1: $99 setup fee (one-time)
   - Line item 2: $299 plan (recurring) with trial_period_days or trial_end
3. Customer pays $99 immediately (PaymentIntent)
4. Subscription created in TRIALING state (no charge yet)
5. [First pickup completed]
6. Trial ended: subscription charges $299 and begins renewal cycle
7. Renewal date anchored to first pickup date
```

### Code Changes (Surgical)

**File:** `supabase/functions/create-checkout/index.ts`

```typescript
// Current (wrong):
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  line_items: [
    {
      price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299,
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  // ... rest of config
});

// New (correct):
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  line_items: [
    // One-time setup fee
    {
      price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP_FEE, // e.g., price_setup_99_onetime
      quantity: 1,
    },
    // Recurring subscription (with trial)
    {
      price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299,
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  subscription_data: {
    trial_period_days: 365, // or trial_end timestamp for exact control
    // trial_end will be overridden when pickup is marked complete
  },
  // Keep existing customer_creation, metadata, success_url, etc.
});
```

### Triggering Subscription (After Pickup)

New Edge Function or API endpoint: **`end-trial-start-subscription`**

```typescript
// Called when first pickup is marked complete
// Input: { customer_id, pickup_completed_at }

export async function endTrialStartSubscription(
  customerId: string,
  pickupCompletedAt: Date
) {
  // 1. Find active trial subscription
  const subs = await stripe.subscriptions.list({
    customer: customerId,
    status: 'trialing',
    limit: 1,
  });

  const subscription = subs.data[0];
  if (!subscription) {
    throw new Error(`No trial subscription found for ${customerId}`);
  }

  // 2. End trial (charge immediately) and reset anchor
  const updated = await stripe.subscriptions.update(subscription.id, {
    trial_end: 'now',
    billing_cycle_anchor: Math.floor(pickupCompletedAt.getTime() / 1000),
    proration_behavior: 'none',
  });

  // 3. Persist subscription ID and start date in Supabase
  await supabase
    .from('customer_profile')
    .update({
      stripe_subscription_id: updated.id,
      subscription_started_at: pickupCompletedAt,
      first_pickup_completed_at: pickupCompletedAt,
    })
    .eq('id', customerId);

  return updated;
}
```

### Why It's Great

- ‚úÖ **One Checkout page** (no multi-step flows)
- ‚úÖ **Native Stripe feature** (no custom workarounds)
- ‚úÖ **Exactly mirrors your intent:** "$99 now, $299 later"
- ‚úÖ **Existing webhooks still work** (only change is trial timing)
- ‚úÖ **Tiny code change** (one Edge Function + one new helper)
- ‚úÖ **Customer sees it clearly** (two line items in checkout preview)

### Stripe API Levers You'll Use

```bash
# Checkout with mixed cart + trial
mode=subscription
line_items[0][price]={{SETUP_FEE_PRICE}}
line_items[1][price]={{RECURRING_PRICE}}
subscription_data[trial_period_days]=365

# End trial after pickup
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUB_ID}} \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d trial_end=now \
  -d billing_cycle_anchor={{PICKUP_UNIX_TIMESTAMP}} \
  -d proration_behavior=none
```

### Best For

- **Primary recommendation** for this scenario
- Clean, professional UX
- Minimal code changes
- Clear customer communication

---

## OPTION C: Trial + Payment Link - Setup Fee Separate

### What You Change

1. **Modify Checkout:** Add free trial to the $299 subscription, remove setup fee from this session
2. **Create Payment Link** in Stripe Dashboard for $99 setup fee (or use a separate Checkout)
3. **Workflow:**
   - Direct signups to Payment Link for $99 (saves card)
   - Then redirect to Checkout for subscription (in free trial)

### Flow

```
Customer clicks "Sign up"
  ‚Üì
[Payment Link 1] Charges $99 setup, saves card
  ‚Üì
Redirects to [Checkout 2] Subscription signup (free trial)
  ‚Üì
Subscription in trial created
  ‚Üì
[First pickup]
  ‚Üì
End trial ‚Üí charge $299
```

### Advantages

- ‚úÖ Payment Link requires zero code (pure Dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Can change Price/Fee without touching code
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns ($99 vs $299)

### Trade-offs

- ‚ùå Two URLs to manage
- ‚ùå Customer sees two "pages" (minor UX friction)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can consolidate to single Checkout later (Option B is final form)

### Best For

- Quick MVP while Option B is in development
- Testing before full consolidation
- Team without immediate code-push capacity

---

## OPTION D: Coupon + Payment Link - Promotional Approach

### What You Change

1. **Create coupon in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Type: Percentage off
   - Discount: 100% (full discount)
   - Duration: `once` (apply once per customer)

2. **Checkout includes coupon field** (optional for customers)

3. **For paid signups:**
   - Charge $99 via Payment Link (setup)
   - Trigger Checkout with 100% coupon applied (subscription at $0 first month)

4. **For waived signups:**
   - Skip the $99 charge
   - Use `mode=setup` Checkout to save card
   - Subscription created with coupon pre-applied

### Flow

```
Customer clicks "Sign up"
  ‚Üì
[Payment Link] $99 setup (or apply coupon code for waived)
  ‚Üì
[Checkout] Subscription with 100% coupon applied (first month free)
  ‚Üì
[First pickup]
  ‚Üì
Coupon expires ‚Üí second charge at full $299
```

### Advantages

- ‚úÖ Dashboard-driven (no code for coupon)
- ‚úÖ Supports promo codes in Checkout (flexible)
- ‚úÖ Good for limited-time offers or waived setups

### Trade-offs

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires coupon scope awareness (applies once per customer globally)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Accounting clarity (coupon tracking vs explicit $99 fee)

### Best For

- Promotions or limited-time offers
- Waived-setup UX
- Testing coupon mechanics

---

## OPTION E: Subscription Schedules / Pause-Collection (Advanced)

### Concept

Subscription Schedules can model a "phase 0" (setup only) and then switch to full price on a date.

### Why It's Not Recommended Here

- ‚ùå **Overkill:** Schedules are for complex multi-phase pricing (e.g., discounted intro, then full price)
- ‚ùå **Extra complexity:** Requires multiple API calls and careful timing
- ‚ùå **Still need one-time $99:** Must use Checkout or Payment Link alongside
- ‚ùå **More failure points:** Trial + schedule achieves the goal with simpler semantics

**Use Subscription Schedules only if you have multiple pricing tiers or multi-year contracts. For setup-then-recurring, Option B is cleaner.**

## RECOMMENDATION MATRIX

| Path | Code Changes | Customer Feel | Accounting | Risk | Best Use |

## Copy-Ready Checklist: What You Need From Stripe

Before implementing any option, confirm you have:

```
PRODUCTS & PRICES (LIVE MODE)
‚ñ° Setup Fee product ($99 one-time)
  - Product name: "Storage Valet Setup Fee" or similar
  - Price ID: price_setup_99_onetime (or your actual ID)
  - Type: One-time charge

‚ñ° Membership product ($299/month recurring)
  - Product name: "Storage Valet Membership" or "Premium"
  - Price ID: price_1SLbacCLlNQ5U3EWLXmhyXTe (CONFIRMED)
  - Type: Recurring (monthly)
  - Billing interval: Monthly

‚ñ° Both products in LIVE mode (not TEST)

FEATURE FLAGS / SETTINGS
‚ñ° If using Option C/D: Payment Link created and shareable
‚ñ° If using Option D: Coupon created (100% off, duration=once)
‚ñ° Stripe Account settings: Automatic Tax on (if applicable)
‚ñ° Webhook endpoint: Configured and verified
```

---

## Implementation Sequence (Option B - Recommended)

### Phase 1: Preparation (30 min)
```bash
1. Confirm both price IDs in Stripe Dashboard
2. Prepare STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP_FEE env var
3. Create feature flag: BILLING_FLOW=setup_then_sub
```

### Phase 2: Code Change (1-2 hours)
```bash
1. Update create-checkout function (mixed cart + trial)
2. Create end-trial-start-subscription endpoint
3. Test in development with Stripe test API keys
```

### Phase 3: Deployment (1 hour)
```bash
1. Deploy updated functions to Supabase
2. Update env vars: STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP_FEE
3. Verify webhook behavior unchanged
```

### Phase 4: Testing (2-3 hours)
```bash
1. Signup flow: pay $99, subscription in trial
2. Trigger end-trial: verify $299 charged
3. Verify billing anchor set to pickup date
4. Test refund / card update edge cases
```

---

## Exact Stripe API Calls (Copyable)

### Create Subscription After Pickup

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \
  -d "items[0][price]"=$STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299 \
  -d collection_method=charge_automatically \
  -d billing_cycle_anchor={{PICKUP_UNIX_TIMESTAMP}} \
  -d proration_behavior=none
```

### End Trial (Charge Immediately, Reset Anchor)

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUB_ID}} \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d trial_end=now \
  -d billing_cycle_anchor={{PICKUP_UNIX_TIMESTAMP}} \
  -d proration_behavior=none
```

### Issue a Credit Note (Refund Option)

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/credit_notes \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d invoice={{INVOICE_ID}} \
  -d refund_amount={{AMOUNT_CENTS}} \
  -d reason=order_change
```

---

## Appendix A Summary

**Option B (Mixed Cart + Trial) is the recommended path.** It requires minimal code changes, uses native Stripe features, and provides the best customer experience and accounting clarity.

---

---

# APPENDIX B: Detailed Setup-Then-Subscription Implementation Plan

*This appendix provides the complete, canonical blueprint for implementing the correct billing flow. Use this to reconcile portal code, Stripe objects, and ops steps so the final deploy matches the business logic.*

---

## 1) SUMMARY: Current vs. Intended

### Current (Buggy)
```
Signup ‚Üí Checkout [$299/month]
  ‚Üì
Customer charged immediately
  ‚Üì
Webhook creates subscription instantly
  ‚Üì
Monthly charges begin BEFORE first pickup
```

### Intended
```
Signup ‚Üí Checkout [$99 one-time setup]
  ‚Üì
Customer charged $99, card saved
  ‚Üì
Webhook creates customer, stores card, NO subscription yet
  ‚Üì
First pickup marked complete
  ‚Üì
Subscription created for $299/month, anchored to pickup date
  ‚Üì
Monthly charges begin AFTER pickup, on anniversary
```

---

## 2) ROOT CAUSES

### Why It's Currently Wrong

1. **Config Drift**
   - `config_pricing.setup_fee_enabled = false` (setup fee is disabled)
   - Flows hard-wired to `STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299` (monthly recurring)
   - No conditional logic to differentiate setup vs. subscription

2. **Webhook Creates Subscription Too Early**
   - `stripe-webhook` function on `checkout.session.completed` creates a subscription
   - No distinction between "payment for setup" vs. "trigger subscription"
   - Subscription created immediately, not deferred to pickup date

3. **Missing Post-Pickup Trigger**
   - No event handler for "first pickup completed"
   - No endpoint to call Subscriptions API after pickup
   - No tracking of first pickup date as subscription anchor

---

## 3) TARGET ARCHITECTURE

### Event Timeline

#### Event 1: Signup ‚Üí Setup Fee

```
Customer clicks "Sign up" ‚Üí Webflow CTA
  ‚Üì
Calls create-checkout Edge Function
  ‚Üì
Stripe Checkout Session created:
  - mode = 'subscription' (for subscription + one-time in mixed cart)
  - line_items[0]: $99 setup (one-time)
  - line_items[1]: $299 plan (recurring) with free trial
  - subscription_data.trial_period_days = 365
  - customer_creation = 'always' (create Stripe Customer)
  - payment_intent_data.setup_future_usage = 'off_session' (save card)
  ‚Üì
Customer redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout page
  ‚Üì
Enters payment details + billing address + phone
  ‚Üì
Clicks "Pay $99"
  ‚Üì
PaymentIntent processes $99
  ‚Üì
Subscription created in TRIALING state (scheduled to be charged later)
  ‚Üì
Webhook receives checkout.session.completed
```

#### Event 2: Webhook Processes Setup

```
Webhook (stripe-webhook function) receives:
  event.type = 'checkout.session.completed'

Validate signature ‚úì
Check idempotency (event_id not seen before) ‚úì
  ‚Üì
DO NOT create subscription (subscription already created by Checkout)
  ‚Üì
DO:
  1. Extract customer details from session:
     - stripe_customer_id = session.customer
     - email = session.customer_details.email
     - phone = session.customer_details.phone
     - address = session.customer_details.address
     - stripe_payment_method = session.payment_method

  2. Upsert customer_profile in Supabase:
     - customer_id (from auth)
     - stripe_customer_id
     - email
     - phone_number
     - address (street, city, state, zip)
     - setup_fee_status = 'paid'
     - tos_accepted_at = now

  3. Store payment context:
     - stripe_customer_json = {customerId, paymentMethod, card}
     - session_id = session.id (reference)

  4. Enqueue async jobs (non-blocking):
     - Send welcome email to customer
     - Log event to Airtable
     - Trigger any third-party integrations

  5. Return HTTP 200 immediately (don't wait for async jobs)

Persist webhook_event (idempotency):
  - event_id = event.id
  - processed_at = now
```

#### Event 3: Customer Uses Portal

```
Customer receives magic link (via Supabase Auth)
  ‚Üì
Logs in to portal
  ‚Üì
Sees empty dashboard (no items yet)
  ‚Üì
Schedules first pickup (future date, with delivery address)
  ‚Üì
Completes first pickup (staff marks as complete)
  ‚Üì
[TRIGGER: First Pickup Completed]
```

#### Event 4: First Pickup Triggered ‚Üí Start Subscription

```
Operations staff (or automated trigger) marks first pickup complete
  ‚Üì
Backend calls start-subscription Edge Function:
  Input: {
    customer_id: "uuid",
    stripe_customer_id: "cus_...",
    pickup_completed_at: "2025-10-30T14:30:00Z"
  }
  ‚Üì
Function logic:
  1. Find active trial subscription for this customer:
     GET /v1/subscriptions?customer={{stripe_customer_id}}&status=trialing

  2. If found, end trial and reset anchor:
     PATCH /v1/subscriptions/{{sub_id}}:
       - trial_end = 'now' (triggers invoice immediately)
       - billing_cycle_anchor = unix(pickup_completed_at)
       - proration_behavior = 'none' (no adjustments)

  3. Persist in Supabase customer_profile:
     - stripe_subscription_id = {{sub_id}}
     - subscription_started_at = pickup_completed_at
     - first_pickup_completed_at = pickup_completed_at
     - subscription_status = 'active'

  4. Enqueue async:
     - Send "Subscription Activated" email
     - Log to Airtable

  5. Return updated subscription
  ‚Üì
Stripe creates invoice for $299
  ‚Üì
Payment collected via saved card (automatic)
  ‚Üì
Customer receives invoice email + charge notification
  ‚Üì
Next month (anniversary): auto-renews on same date
```

---

## 4) IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### A) Dashboard Setup (One-Time)

**In Stripe Dashboard:**

1. **Products/Prices**
   - Verify Setup Fee product exists: "$99 one-time"
     - Price ID: `price_setup_99_onetime` (or actual)
     - Type: one_time

   - Verify Membership product exists: "$299/month recurring"
     - Price ID: `price_1SLbacCLlNQ5U3EWLXmhyXTe` (CONFIRMED)
     - Type: recurring, billing_period: month

2. **Checkout (Optional Dashboard Preset)**
   - Enable Promotion Codes (for future flexibility)
   - Require Billing Address (for delivery)
   - Require Phone (for contact)
   - Automatic Tax: ON (if applicable)
   - Success Behavior: Redirect with ?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}

3. **Webhook Endpoint (Verify)**
   - URL: `https://gmjucacmbrumncfnnhua.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
   - Events subscribed:
     - checkout.session.completed ‚úì
     - customer.subscription.created (optional)
     - customer.subscription.updated (optional)
     - invoice.payment_succeeded (optional, for logging)

---

### B) Code Changes (Edge Functions)

#### File 1: `functions/create-checkout/index.ts`

**Current (wrong):**
```typescript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  line_items: [
    {
      price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299,
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  customer_creation: 'always',
  payment_intent_data: {
    setup_future_usage: 'off_session',
  },
  success_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/login`,
});
```

**New (correct for mixed cart + trial):**
```typescript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  line_items: [
    // One-time setup fee
    {
      price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP_FEE, // e.g., price_setup_99_onetime
      quantity: 1,
    },
    // Recurring subscription (with free trial)
    {
      price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299,
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  subscription_data: {
    trial_period_days: 365, // Or trial_end: future date
  },
  customer_creation: 'always',
  payment_intent_data: {
    setup_future_usage: 'off_session', // Save card for later use
  },
  success_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/login`,
});
```

#### File 2: `functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Key Change: Do NOT create subscription**

```typescript
if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
  const session = event.data.object;

  // CRITICAL: Check idempotency
  const isDuplicate = await checkEventIdSeen(event.id); // DB query
  if (isDuplicate) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), { status: 200 });
  }

  // Validate payment
  if (session.payment_status !== 'paid') {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), { status: 200 });
  }

  try {
    // 1. Extract customer details
    const stripeCustomerId = session.customer;
    const email = session.customer_details?.email;
    const phone = session.customer_details?.phone;
    const address = session.customer_details?.address;

    // 2. Upsert customer_profile
    await supabase
      .from('customer_profile')
      .upsert({
        stripe_customer_id: stripeCustomerId,
        email,
        phone_number: phone,
        address_street: address?.line1,
        address_city: address?.city,
        address_state: address?.state,
        address_zip: address?.postal_code,
        setup_fee_status: 'paid',
        tos_accepted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      }, {
        onConflict: 'stripe_customer_id',
      });

    // 3. Store webhook event for idempotency
    await supabase
      .from('webhook_events')
      .insert({
        event_id: event.id,
        event_type: event.type,
        processed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      });

    // 4. Enqueue async jobs (non-blocking)
    await enqueueTasks([
      { type: 'send_welcome_email', email },
      { type: 'log_to_airtable', customer_id: stripeCustomerId },
    ]);

    // 5. Return immediately
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), { status: 200 });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook error:', error);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

#### File 3: `functions/start-subscription/index.ts` (NEW)

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";
import Stripe from "https://esm.sh/stripe@12.0.0";

const stripe = new Stripe(Deno.env.get("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"), {
  apiVersion: "2023-10-16",
});

serve(async (req) => {
  // POST /start-subscription
  // Body: { stripe_customer_id, pickup_completed_at }

  try {
    const { stripe_customer_id, pickup_completed_at } = await req.json();

    if (!stripe_customer_id || !pickup_completed_at) {
      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({ error: "Missing customer_id or pickup_date" }),
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // 1. Find active trial subscription
    const subscriptions = await stripe.subscriptions.list({
      customer: stripe_customer_id,
      status: 'trialing',
      limit: 1,
    });

    if (!subscriptions.data.length) {
      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({ error: "No trial subscription found" }),
        { status: 404 }
      );
    }

    const subscription = subscriptions.data[0];
    const pickupTimestamp = Math.floor(new Date(pickup_completed_at).getTime() / 1000);

    // 2. End trial and reset billing anchor
    const updated = await stripe.subscriptions.update(subscription.id, {
      trial_end: 'now',
      billing_cycle_anchor: pickupTimestamp,
      proration_behavior: 'none',
    });

    // 3. Persist in Supabase
    const supabaseUrl = Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL");
    const supabaseKey = Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY");

    const supabaseResponse = await fetch(`${supabaseUrl}/rest/v1/customer_profile`, {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${supabaseKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Prefer': 'return=minimal',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        stripe_subscription_id: updated.id,
        subscription_started_at: pickup_completed_at,
        first_pickup_completed_at: pickup_completed_at,
        subscription_status: 'active',
      }),
      query: `stripe_customer_id=eq.${stripe_customer_id}`,
    });

    if (!supabaseResponse.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Supabase update failed: ${await supabaseResponse.text()}`);
    }

    // 4. Enqueue async jobs
    // (email, airtable, logging, etc.)

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ success: true, subscription: updated }),
      { status: 200, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
    );

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('start-subscription error:', error);
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }),
      { status: 500, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
    );
  }
});
```

---

### C) Database Changes (Small)

**Table: `customer_profile`**

Add columns (if not present):
```sql
ALTER TABLE customer_profile ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS (
  first_pickup_completed_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  subscription_status VARCHAR(50) NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  setup_fee_status VARCHAR(50) NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

**Why These Columns:**
- `first_pickup_completed_at`: Track when subscription should start (anchor date)
- `subscription_status`: Track lifecycle (pending ‚Üí active ‚Üí paused ‚Üí cancelled)
- `setup_fee_status`: Track if setup was paid or waived

**Optional Trigger:**
```sql
-- Auto-trigger subscription start when first_pickup_completed_at is set
-- (if not already in trialing state)
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_subscription_on_pickup
AFTER UPDATE ON customer_profile
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.first_pickup_completed_at IS NOT NULL
      AND OLD.first_pickup_completed_at IS NULL)
BEGIN
  -- Call start-subscription Edge Function or webhook
  -- (implementation depends on architecture)
END;
```

---

### D) Feature Flags & Config

**Environment Variables (Supabase Secrets):**

```bash
# Existing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
APP_URL=https://portal.mystoragevalet.com

# New
STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP_FEE=price_setup_99_onetime
STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM299=price_1SLbacCLlNQ5U3EWLXmhyXTe

# Feature flags
BILLING_FLOW=setup_then_sub              # Guards new logic
ALLOW_SUBSCRIPTION_ON_SIGNUP=false       # Explicitly disable old path
SETUP_FEE_ENABLED=true                   # Reflect business logic in config
SETUP_FEE_AMOUNT_CENTS=9900              # $99.00
```

---

## 5) MIGRATION & ROLLOUT

### Code Changes (Feature Flags)

```typescript
// Wrap the new logic behind a flag
if (process.env.BILLING_FLOW === 'setup_then_sub') {
  // New mixed-cart logic
} else {
  // Old logic (deprecated)
}
```

### Data Backfill (For Existing Premature Charges)

**Scenario:** Customers already charged $299 before this fix.

**Option A: Refund + Recreate**
```bash
For each premature charge:
1. Issue refund via Stripe Dashboard
2. Create new subscription with anchor = pickup date
```

**Option B: Credit Note + Anchor Reset**
```bash
For each premature charge:
1. Issue credit note for pre-service period
2. Reset billing_cycle_anchor to pickup date
3. Prorated next invoice reflects credit
```

### Release Sequence

1. **Deploy Code** (feature flag OFF)
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy create-checkout
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
   supabase functions deploy start-subscription (new)
   ```

2. **Train Operations**
   - Document the new flow
   - Explain when to call start-subscription
   - Show how to handle edge cases (failed charges, card updates)

3. **Enable Feature Flag**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set BILLING_FLOW=setup_then_sub
   supabase functions deploy create-checkout (with flag enabled)
   ```

4. **Monitor**
   - Track webhook logs (should not create subscriptions on signup)
   - Track start-subscription calls (should create subscriptions on pickup)
   - Monitor Stripe events for anomalies

## 10) RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **No card on file if setup waived** | Use `mode=setup` Checkout to collect card without charging |
| **Duplicate customers (email mismatch)** | Prefer Stripe Customer ID, lock email in Checkout if known |
| **Card removed before pickup** | Catch error in start-subscription, prompt customer to add card |
| **Subscription creation fails** | Implement retry logic + alerting for payment failures |
| **Team forgets new flow exists** | Keep this doc as source of truth; gate code behind flags; maintain change log |
| **Premature charges to existing customers** | Use credit notes or refund + recreate subscription |

## 12) CANONICAL BLUEPRINT SUMMARY

This document is the **source of truth** for the setup-then-subscription billing model. It defines:

1. ‚úÖ **What's wrong** (current vs. intended)
2. ‚úÖ **Why it's wrong** (root causes)
3. ‚úÖ **What's needed** (target architecture)
4. ‚úÖ **How to build it** (step-by-step implementation)
5. ‚úÖ **How to verify it** (acceptance criteria + test matrix)
6. ‚úÖ **How to deploy it** (rollout sequence)
7. ‚úÖ **How to handle edge cases** (risks + mitigations)

Use this blueprint to ensure the final implementation matches the business logic without surprises.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED ‚Äî Awaiting decision on billing architecture

**Decision Required By:** You (Zach)

**Three Key Questions:**
1. Is the intended flow above correct?
2. Are the Stripe products already created?
3. Is +2-4 days acceptable for this fix?

**Recommended Path:** Option B (Mixed Cart + Trial) ‚Äî 4-6 hours code, minimal risk, maximum clarity

**Next Step:** Answer the three questions, approve the architecture, and I'll execute the implementation with full confidence.
